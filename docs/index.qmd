### A best practice toolkit for creating Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) compliant Quarto publications

- The gold standard for creating analytical outputs in government[^goldacre]
- Uses open standards to promote best practice across the sector
- Transparancy increases trust and confidence in published data
- Allows others to verify and replicate complex analysis

### Interactive Markdown Reports
Templates for interactive `.html` reports in Markdown; a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. Templates can be parameterised to create multiple versions of the same report, charts, and analyses for many different geographical hierarchies.

### Make-like Data Pipelines
Use `{targets}` to define dependencies in data processing pipelines. Specify the order in which tasks should be executed, and automatically rebuild parts of the pipeline if the input data or any of the intermediate results change.

### Library of Tested Functions
A shared library of unit tested functions that highly complex analysis can be run knowing that every step in the calculation is fully validated and documented. These functions can be further developed, re-used, and improved upon as part of a collaborative effort.

### Continuous Integration
Continuous integration (CI) automates builds and tests. So when something stops working you will both be informed about the problem and told how you can fix it. This can reduce the time it takes to validate new data and update your publications.
